# FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Certification Projects

I am excited to share my journey in completing all the **Quality Assurance Certification** projects from [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/). These projects focus on testing, debugging, and ensuring the reliability of web applications using Chai, Mocha, and advanced testing techniques.

## Projects in This Repository

1. **Metric-Imperial Converter**: An API that converts units between the metric and imperial systems.
2. **Issue Tracker**: A full-stack application for managing issues and bug reports.
3. **Personal Library**: A RESTful API to store and manage book collections.
4. **Sudoku Solver**: A tool to solve Sudoku puzzles programmatically.
5. **American/British Translator**: A web app that translates text between American and British English.

## Features

- **Node.js & Express.js**: All projects are built using these technologies for efficient backend development.
- **Chai & Mocha**: Comprehensive testing with assertion libraries and test runners.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Some projects store and retrieve data using MongoDB.
- **RESTful API Design**: Follows industry-standard HTTP methods for communication.
- **Automated Testing**: Includes unit and functional tests to ensure application reliability.
