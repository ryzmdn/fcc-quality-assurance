# FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Certification Projects

I am happy to share my journey in completing all the **Quality Assurance** certification projects of [freeCodeCamp Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/).
These projects apply the concepts of **automated testing**, **Chai.js**, **Mocha**, and **API testing** to ensure that applications work as expected and meet software quality standards.

Inside this repository, you will find **5 projects** that I have completed. You can use it as a reference or guide in learning and implementing automation testing.

## Projects in Repositories

1. **Metric-Imperial Converter**. Implement an API to convert units between metric and imperial systems, and ensure accuracy with unit tests using Chai.js.
2. **Issue Tracker**. An application to track bug reports or features within a project, complete with CRUD operations and API testing to ensure functionality.
3. **Personal Library**. A REST API that manages a collection of books, allowing users to add, delete, and retrieve book lists. Comes with automated testing.
4. **Sudoku Solver**. A tool for solving Sudoku puzzles that can accept user input and return solutions, and be tested using unit tests.
5. **American British Translator**. An API that translates text between American English and British English, ensuring accurate translation results with automated testing.
